This repo contains sample queries for [Advanced hunting](https://security.microsoft.com/hunting) in [Microsoft Threat Protection](https://aka.ms/mtp-docs).
With these sample queries, you can start to experience Advanced hunting, including the types of data that it covers and the query language it supports. You can also explore a variety of attack techniques and how they may be surfaced through Advanced hunting.

To get started, simply paste a sample query into the query builder and run the query. If you get syntax errors, try removing empty lines introduced when pasting. If a query returns no results, try expanding the time range. 

We are continually building up documentation about Advanced hunting and its data schema. You can access the full list of tables and columns in the portal or reference the following resources:

- [Advanced hunting overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/advanced-hunting-overview)
- [Language overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/advanced-hunting-query-language)

## How to contribute

Everyone can freely add a file for a new query or improve on existing queries in the [queries folder](https://github.com/microsoft/MTP-AHQ/tree/master/queries). To help other users locate new queries quickly, we suggest that you:

- Create a new MarkDown file in the [queries folder](https://github.com/microsoft/MTP-AHQ/tree/master/queries) with contents based on the [query submission template](queries\00-query-submission-template.md)   
- In the new file:
    - Provide a name for the query that represents the components or activities that it searches for, e.g. `Files from malicious sender` 
    - Describe the query and provide sufficient guidance when applicable
    - Select the categories that apply by marking the appropriate cell with a "v"
- Use the query name as the title, separating each word with a hyphen (-), e.g. `files-from-malicious-sender.md`
